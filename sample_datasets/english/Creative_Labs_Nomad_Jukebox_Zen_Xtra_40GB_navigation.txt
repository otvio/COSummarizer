[1] 1 - navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
[1] 2 - also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
[1] 3 - took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
[1] 4 - the navigation is nice enough , but scrolling and searching through thousands of tracks , hundreds of albums or artists , or even dozens of genres is not conducive to save driving .
[1] 5 - it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
[1] 6 - navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice versa ) was easy too .
[1] 7 - 2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
[1] 8 - easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumbwheel scroll / pushbutton .
[1] 9 - pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
[0] 1 - navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
[0] 2 - in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders .
[0] 3 - you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division .
[0] 4 - navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
[0] 5 - difficult navigation - i wo n't necessarily say " difficult , " but i do n't enjoy the scrollwheel to navigate .
[0] 6 - it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly .
[0] 7 - i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
[0] 8 - navigation could be better , but there is n't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it .
