[1] 1 - each battery lasts about 10-11 hours.
[1] 2 - about the product:  the zen micro is a sleek, stylish device that caters not just to "hip" youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life, size, or the "awkward" factor.
[1] 3 - battery life is exceptional, lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market.
[1] 4 - i imagine if i left my player untouched (no backlight) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level.
[1] 5 - songs transfer lightning fast, and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time.
[1] 6 - +battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +awesome sound quality... i mean it is creative right?
[1] 7 - actually, the creative zen micro solves all that.
[1] 8 - it beats apple on the storage space, it beats apple on the removable battery (and batter life), and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel.
[1] 9 - some features that the 'zen micro' has that sold me on my purchase include: a 5g hard drive...actually an sd flash card drive...very large and much more than actually needed, the ability to sync with microsoft outlook's calendar, the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours (i can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs.
[0] 1 - there are 2 things that need fixing  first is the battery life. it will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons.
[0] 2 - the only reason for not giving it 5 stars: the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player, but in real life i can probably get 6-8 hours at most.
[0] 3 - even the "shorter" battery life, though, has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way.
[0] 4 - - the battery life leaves a lot to be desired.
[0] 5 - the battery, as others have said, also seems weaker than creative suggests.
[0] 6 - where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable (and they included a second one free).
[0] 7 - i would give it about 6 or 7 hours, although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles.
