[1] 1 - the package also comes with a usb cable, an ac adapter, a pair of headphones (they're okay until you get a better pair), a stand, and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in.
[1] 2 - the earbuds are great headphones as good as my agk studio 240, well not as good but darn close.
[1] 3 - the earbud headphones are really nice.
[1] 4 - the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it (a stand, a belt hook, charger) that i know doesn't come with every one.
[1] 5 - the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds.
