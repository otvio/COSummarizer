[1] 1 - i do give create to creative for their attractive design.
[1] 2 - all-in-all, creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features, and i look forward to the nomad/zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype.
[1] 3 - perhaps i bought the micro to be different, the cheaper price tag (from amazon), the design, or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways.
[1] 4 - strong points: - design: small, comfortable, curved, and stylish.
[1] 5 - creative did an awesome job with the design.
[1] 6 - so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features, and find them well designed, and easy to understand.
[1] 7 - pros the design is very nice, and the colors are too.
[1] 8 - it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design.
[0] 1 - i dont use the belt clip cuz it fails to hold the player securely (design problem).
[0] 2 - although, i thought it could've been designed a bit better.
[0] 3 - ouch pad[-2], design[-1], volume control[-1] weak points: - touch pad: design could be better - volume control: controlled through the vertical strip, but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick.
[0] 4 - but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design.
[0] 5 - but, the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious, serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw, and i'm going to tell you what it is...but first, two more things about this piece of garbage that's so great and could've made it a potenial ipod killer.
[0] 6 - but, all of this means nothing, because of the serious, serious, stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw: after 3 months, give or take a few weeks, you won't be able to hear anything.
