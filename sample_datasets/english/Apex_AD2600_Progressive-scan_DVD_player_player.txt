[1] 1 - i 've had the player for about 2 years now and it still performs nicely with the exception of an occasional wwhhhrrr sound from the motor .

[1] 7 - i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
[1] 8 - ( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )
[1] 9 - while i would like to give it 3.5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
[1] 10 - nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .
[1] 11 - well , it was nice while it lasted .
[1] 12 - i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
[1] 13 - i am very pleased with the apex ad2600.it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .

[1] 16 - this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
[1] 17 - this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
[1] 18 - i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
[1] 19 - for the most part this is a good dvd player .
[1] 20 - i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .

[1] 22 - as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
[1] 23 - this player seems to work fine with everything else .

[1] 25 - so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .

[1] 35 - the dvd player is fine .
[1] 36 - of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .

[1] 39 - i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
[1] 40 - this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
[1] 41 - i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it !

[1] 43 - it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
[1] 44 - works great !
[0] 1 - i know the saying is " you get what you pay for " but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse .
[0] 2 - i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media .
[0] 3 - this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n't purchase it .

[0] 17 - 3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
[0] 18 - after @ 3 months , it stoppped playing higher number scenes on dvds .
[0] 19 - as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale .

[0] 21 - the dvd player just would't recognize them .
[0] 22 - i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disapointed !

[0] 44 - update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product !
[0] 45 - when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door .
[0] 46 - when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn " t work either !
[0] 47 - i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
[0] 48 - only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
[0] 49 - the player kept displaying " no disc " , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * !
[0] 50 - 1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , " dad ! somethings wrong with the dvd player ! come quick ! "
[0] 51 - one still works fine , the other quit after one day .
[0] 52 - after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift .
[0] 53 - all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing crappiness of this very embarassing gift .
[0] 54 - i was impressed by this very inexpensive player.for the first three hours , and then it died .
[0] 55 - i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n't do it !
[0] 56 - i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n't work !
