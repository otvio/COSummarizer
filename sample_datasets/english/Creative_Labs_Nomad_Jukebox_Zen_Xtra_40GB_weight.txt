[1] 1 - like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
[1] 2 - at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
[1] 3 - other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
[1] 4 - it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
[1] 5 - it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
[1] 6 - it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
[1] 7 - there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
[0] 1 - first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
[0] 2 - 1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
[0] 3 - a little weighty ( 9 ounces ... no biggie ) , but otherwise fine .
[0] 4 - it 's only slightly heavier than the ipod , and has a longer battery life .
[0] 5 - its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
[0] 6 - it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman .
[0] 7 - kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
