[1] 1 - like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
[1] 2 - other plusses : changable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
[1] 3 - overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod !
[1] 4 - it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
[1] 5 - nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
[1] 6 - the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
[1] 7 - it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
[1] 8 - it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
[1] 9 - lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
[1] 10 - it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
[1] 11 - this did n't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
[1] 12 - despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box !
[1] 13 - the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
[1] 14 - in short , this player is good at size , value , hardware design but really bad at its software
[1] 15 - the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
[0] 1 - it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to .
[0] 2 - size - bigger than the ipod
[0] 3 - first , the cons ... a tad bulky ... not the most asthetic looking player ... and does n't support a folder stucture .
[0] 4 - sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much .
[0] 5 - 1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more .
[0] 6 - the sound is indeed excellent and the form factore is not bad ( but still rather larger than i had expected ) .. .
[0] 7 - it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it .
[0] 8 - i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
[0] 9 - there are a couple things i didnt like though but nothing serious : a little larger than other mp3s but still light , the software takes some time to get used to ( maybe 10-15 mins ) , and this thing would definitely be destroyed with one fall .
[0] 10 - its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
[0] 11 - kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that .
