[1] 1 - the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy, but it works well and provides good accuracy.
[1] 2 - i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too.
[1] 3 - i don't have problems with the depth adjustment, the speed control, the collet ( i haven't tried the 1/4" sleeve yet) .
[1] 4 - it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth prescisely.
[1] 5 - the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router.
[1] 6 - it's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool, and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great.
[1] 7 - the height adjustment works well- not perfect.
[0] 1 - the adjustment knob seemed ok, but when lowering the router, i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob.
[0] 2 - i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits.
[0] 3 - the depth adjustment was sloppy.
[0] 4 - the only not-so-positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment, it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately.
[0] 5 - the major reasons i didn't give it a five are:  one, i didn't think the fine adjustment worked well.
[0] 6 - i replaced it with a router raizer and it works much better.
