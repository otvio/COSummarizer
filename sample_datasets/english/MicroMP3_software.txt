[1] 1 - user interface: the software is simple and straight forward.
[1] 2 - transferring files couldn't be easier thanks to the included software bundle.
[1] 3 - also, i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software, which i had with audigy zs sound card originally; it is definitely an added plus.
[1] 4 - creative has excellent music software, a very responsive tech support group (they are quick on firmware updates, and make them publicly available), and usually a good array of accessories.
[1] 5 - the software is very easy to use, and the transfer is super fast!
[1] 6 - it's easy to use, and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch.
[1] 7 - the greatest thing about the software (in my humble) is that it reads your cd info.
[0] 1 - who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "foreign" computer just to move over some simple (*.txt) files?
[0] 2 - software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it,it  does the job well.
[0] 3 - the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered, and excludes my favorite feature in itunes, the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder.
[0] 4 - it seems like the software is just not responding.
[0] 5 - while the software may not be as easy as i-tunes, it is not difficult to use by any stretch.
[0] 6 - still has terrible software.
[0] 7 - you have to wonder why creative can't get this right.
[0] 8 - is not as intuitive as i would like.
[0] 9 - the machine itself seems fine, but the software that came with it is awful.
