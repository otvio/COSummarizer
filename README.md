# COSummarizer

<p align="justify">
This project aims to solve the Contrastive Opinion Summarization task using an optimization-based approach. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
The method models the summarization task as an Optimization
problem and it uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Optimization techniques to generate
a representative and comparative summary from customer reviews about a topic, product or
service. 
</p>
<p align="justify">
In a more technical way, the goal of this project is to extract sentences from positive and
negative sets of opinions on a topic and generate a comparative summary containing sentence
pairs that are both contrastive to each other and representative with respect to the given sets of
opinions.
</p>

This repository contains the implementation of a Contrastive Opinion Summarizer based on the work of Kim & Zhai (2009). 

For more instructions on how to use the COSummarizer or the Evaluation script, please read the first section of the scripts.
